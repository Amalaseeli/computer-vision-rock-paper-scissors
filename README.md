# Computer Vision RPS

## Step-1:

### Create image project model with four different classes:
- Rock
- Paper
- Scissors
- Nothing
 
 by using <a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/" target=_blank> Teachable machine</a> I created the model and trained with around 100 images in each class

## Step2:
### 1. Create a new Virtual Conda environment.
### 2. Installed necessary libraries
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV-python
- Ipykernel

### <b>Any user can install and exact dependencies by running <i> pip install requirements.txt.</i></b>


### Manually checked the code by running manual_rps.py
